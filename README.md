# vimigo_test

This application is to assess how well are the technical skills of a potential frontend developer. 
My submissions will determine which skill level you are evaluated at.

These are the requirements:

As a frontend developer, you are expected to develop a Flutter application with a list of
attendance records with the reference of the data set provided below.
1. Display the records in the form of list view and sorted based on the time.
2. The list of records should be sorted from the most recent to the oldest.
3. The time format should be displayed in the format of “time ago” eg. 1 hour ago.
4. The time format is also able to be displayed in another format “dd MMM yyyy, h:mm a”
   with the change of toggle button.
5. The time format changes should be kept even if users terminate/kill the app.
6. Users are able to add a new attendance record into the list.
7. When a user successfully adds a new record to the list, an indicator should be displayed
   that user had successfully completed the action.
8. Users are able to search through the list based on the keyword that users key in.
9. Users are able to see a particular record in another page.
10. An indicator should inform the user that “You have reached the end of the list” when
    the user scrolled to the end of the list.
11. An onboarding screen / introduction screen should be shown to educate users how to
    use the app when a new user first opens up the app.
12. Users are able to share the contact information from the attendance records to other
    applications that are installed.
